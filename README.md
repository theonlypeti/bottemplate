# Project Name

This is a template for a Discord bot project written in Python, using the nextcord library. It serves as a starting point for creating your own Discord bots.

## Template Files

The bot's functionality is divided into several template files:

- `templatecog.py`: This is a general template for creating new cogs.
- `redditcog.py`: This is a cog that handles interactions with Reddit, including retrieving random posts from specified subreddits and sending random cat pictures.
- `wordlecog.py`: This is a template for creating a cog that implements views, buttons and a modal to implement games such as Wordle.

Each file contains example functions and commands that you can modify to suit your needs.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `install.bat`
3. As per the installation instructions, supply your bot token in the `credentials\main.env` file.
4. After installation the bot should automatically launch. 

    Run the bot maunally: `python main.py`

5. Invite the bot to your server using the generated invite link from your Discord Developer Portal.
